欢迎来到互联网上学习PyTorch的第二好地方（第一名是[PyTorch文档](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)）。

这是[学习PyTorch深度学习：从零到精通课程](https://dbourke.link/ZTMPyTorch)的在线书籍版本。

这个课程将教你使用PyTorch（一个用Python编写的机器学习框架）的机器学习和深度学习基础。

课程是基于视频的。但是，视频基于这本在线书籍的内容。

完整的代码和资源请参见[课程GitHub](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning)。

否则，你可以在下面找到更多关于课程的信息。

## 本课程涵盖PyTorch 2.0吗？

是的。PyTorch 2.0是PyTorch以前版本的增量发布。

这意味着它在PyTorch现有基线功能之上添加了新功能。

本课程专注于PyTorch的基线功能（例如，你是想进入深度学习/AI的初学者）。

一旦你了解了PyTorch的基础知识，PyTorch 2.0是一个快速升级，在这个网站上有一个[教程](https://www.learnpytorch.io/pytorch_2_intro/)，介绍了新功能。

## About this course

### Who is this course for?

**You:** Are a beginner in the field of machine learning or deep learning or AI and would like to learn PyTorch.

**This course:** Teaches you PyTorch and many machine learning, deep learning and AI concepts in a hands-on, code-first way.

If you already have 1-year+ experience in machine learning, this course may help but it is specifically designed to be beginner-friendly.

### What are the prerequisites?

1. 3-6 months coding Python.
2. At least one beginner machine learning course (however this might be able to be skipped, resources are linked for many different topics).
3. Experience using Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab (though you can pick this up as we go along).
4. A willingness to learn (most important).

For 1 & 2, I'd recommend the [Zero to Mastery Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://dbourke.link/ZTMMLcourse), it'll teach you the fundamentals of machine learning and Python (I'm biased though, I also teach that course).

### How is the course taught?

All of the course materials are available for free in an online book at [learnpytorch.io](https://learnpytorch.io). If you like to read, I'd recommend going through the resources there.

If you prefer to learn via video, the course is also taught in apprenticeship-style format, meaning I write PyTorch code, you write PyTorch code.

There's a reason the course motto's include *if in doubt, run the code* and *experiment, experiment, experiment!*.

My whole goal is to help you to do one thing: learn machine learning by writing PyTorch code.

The code is all written via [Google Colab Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com) (you could also use Jupyter Notebooks), an incredible free resource to experiment with machine learning.

### What will I get if I finish the course?

There's certificates and all that jazz if you go through the videos.

But certificates are meh.

You can consider this course a machine learning momentum builder.

By the end, you'll have written hundreds of lines of PyTorch code.

And will have been exposed to many of the most important concepts in machine learning.

So when you go to build your own machine learning projects or inspect a public machine learning project made with PyTorch, it'll feel familiar and if it doesn't, at least you'll know where to look.

### What will I build in the course?

We start with the barebone fundamentals of PyTorch and machine learning, so even if you're new to machine learning you'll be caught up to speed.

Then we’ll explore more advanced areas including PyTorch neural network classification, PyTorch workflows, computer vision, custom datasets, experiment tracking, model deployment, and my personal favourite: transfer learning, a powerful technique for taking what one machine learning model has learned on another problem and applying it to your own!

Along the way, you’ll build three milestone projects surrounding an overarching project called FoodVision, a neural network computer vision model to classify images of food. 

These milestone projects will help you practice using PyTorch to cover important machine learning concepts and create a portfolio you can show employers and say "here's what I've done".

### How do I approach this course?

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/main/images/docs-how-to-approach-this-course-no-header.png" width=900 alt="how to approach this course: 1. code along, 2. explore and experiment, 3. visualize what you don't understand, 4. ask questions, 5. do the exercises, 6. share your work"/>

As mentioned, the video version of the course is taught apprenticeship style.

Meaning I write PyTorch code, you write PyTorch code.

But here's what I recommend:

1. **Code along (*if in doubt, run the code*)** - Follow along with code and try to write as much of it as you can yourself, keep doing so until you find yourself writing PyTorch code in your subconscious that's when you can stop writing the same code over and over again. 
2. **Explore and experiment (*experiment, experiment, experiment!*)** - Machine learning (and deep learning) is very experimental. So if you find yourself wanting to try something on your own and ignoring the materials, do it.
3. **Visualize what you don't understand (*visualize, visualize, visualize!*)** - Numbers on a page can get confusing. So make things colourful, see what the inputs and outputs of your code looks like.
4. **Ask questions** - If you're stuck with something, ask a question, trying searching for it or if nothing comes up, the course [GitHub Discussions page](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/discussions) will be the place to go.
5. **Do the exercises** - Each module of the course comes with a dedicated exercises section. It's important to try these on your own. You will get stuck. But that's the nature of learning something new: everyone gets stuck.
6. **Share your work** - If you've learned something cool or even better, made something cool, share it. It could be with the course Discord group or on the course GitHub page or on your own website. The benefits of sharing your work is you get to practice communicating as well as others can help you out if you're not sure of something.

### Do I need to take things in order?

The notebooks/chapters build upon each other sequentially but feel free to jump around.

### How do I get started?

You can read the materials on any device but this course is best viewed and coded along within a desktop browser.

The course uses a free tool called Google Colab. If you've got no experience with it, I'd go through the free [Introduction to Google Colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) and then come back here.

To start:

1. Click on one of the notebook or section links like "[00. PyTorch Fundamentals](https://www.learnpytorch.io/00_pytorch_fundamentals/)". 
2. Click the "Open in Colab" button up the top.
3. Press SHIFT+Enter a few times and see what happens.

Happy machine learning!
